dataset publishing: desert fertilization

This repository is the home of publishing processes for the desert fertilization project beginning with version 632.3. Resources, workflows, and processes for database creation, the initial publication, and previous versions (632.1, 632.2) are in the 'cndep' repo that resides with GIOS on AWS. However, the R script file that documents the creation of the database and initial publication have been moved to this repo, and the 'cndep' repo should be able to be ignored going forward. 'cndep' had also held the data, but those are all now moved to the cndep folder of the department drive.
