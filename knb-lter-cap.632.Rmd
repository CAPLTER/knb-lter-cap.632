type, the initial ICP tissue data processing is isolated in a separate workflow

xml for the tissue icp dt and other entity are recycled from earlier versions
of the knb-lter-cap.632 xml/eml.

# atmospheric deposition

There is a sharp contrast in the structure of the Lachat data where dilutions
are not calculuted in an earlier method but are calculated by the method in
later years. Among the resin data, the transition occurs between 2012 and 2014.
The workflow below included steps to calculate the concentration factoring in
the dilution where needed for earlier data.

Careful that the transition between the Lachat format occurs in 2013 for the
set of data available for knb-lter-cap.632.9 but that may not always be the
case as new data are added from historic runs. For example, it is unclear when
exactly the method changed. This will not be an issue once we have addressed
all of the historic data, but the data should be examined until that time.

We add a unique run_id for each Lachat run. This is needed so that a user can
associate a blanks with the corresponding samples in an analytical run,
espcially since there are not collection dates on blanks. Here I use a simple
integer for the run_id instead of somthing like the Lachat run_file_name from
which the run_id is generated just as something a bit simpler and more
digestible to a user.

For atmospheric deposition blanks:

* solution blanks (e.g., `BLK.BLK1`) are the 0.2 M KCl extract solution that is
  run through a filter. This solution is used to construct the standard curves
  so, really, this information is probably not all that useful to a user since
  you would not want to back out a blank signal from a solution used also for
  the stands but the data are included for completeness.
* field blanks (e.g., `WTM.LATR CNTL1`) are the resin collectors that are
  capped and deployed to the field but never exposed to the atmosphere.
* run blanks (e.g., `resin.KCl.1`) are constructed by performing the complete
  extraction procedure on an aliquot of clean resin material that was not
  deployed in the field or otherwise used in any way.

## taxonomic coverage

*Note* that the `taxa_map.csv` built with the `create_taxa_map()` function and
resolving taxonomic IDs (i.e., `resolve_comm_taxa()`) only needs to be run once
per version/session -- the taxonomicCoverage can be built as many times as
needed with `resolve_comm_taxa()` once the `taxa_map.csv` has been generated and
the taxonomic IDs resolved.

```{r taxonomyCleanr, eval=TRUE}

my_path <- getwd() # taxonomyCleanr requires a path (to build the taxa_map)

# get dataset taxa
dataset_taxa <- dbGetQuery(pg,"
  SELECT
  DISTINCT(cover_type)
  FROM urbancndep.cover_types
  WHERE cover_category LIKE 'annual';"
  ) |> 
dplyr::mutate(cover_type = gsub("_", " ", cover_type)) |>
dplyr::filter(!stringr::str_detect(cover_type, "unident")) |> 
# annuals taxa above, additional taxa below
tibble::add_row(cover_type = 'Larrea tridentata') |> 
tibble::add_row(cover_type = 'Ambrosia dumosa') |> 
tibble::add_row(cover_type = 'Ambrosia deltoidea') |> 
tibble::add_row(cover_type = 'Pectocarya recurvata') |> 
tibble::add_row(cover_type = 'Amsinckia menziesii') |> 
tibble::add_row(cover_type = 'Schismus arabicus') |> 
dplyr::distinct(cover_type)

# create or update map. A taxa_map.csv is the heart of taxonomyCleanr. This
# function will build the taxa_map.csv and put it in the path identified with
# my_path.
taxonomyCleanr::create_taxa_map(path = my_path, x = dataset_taxa, col = "cover_type") 

# resolve taxa by attempting to match the taxon's In this case, data.source 3 is
# ITIS (which, by the way, is the only authority taxonomyCleanr will allow for
# common names).
# resolve_comm_taxa(path = my_path, data.sources = 3) # in this case, 3 is ITIS
taxonomyCleanr::resolve_sci_taxa(path = my_path, data.sources = 3) # in this case, 3 is ITIS
